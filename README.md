ask 1 – Local Network Port Scanning

This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the Cybersecurity Internship.

## Objective
Perform a network scan on the local subnet using **Nmap** to identify open ports, services, and potential risks.

## Files
- `task1_port_scan_report_anonymized.pdf` → Full report (with IPs redacted)
- `scan_results_anonymized.txt` → Example Nmap scan results (anonymized)
- `README.md` → This file

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with port scanning and service enumeration  
- Learned how open ports can expose systems to threats if left unsecured  
- Understood the importance of firewalls and disabling unnecessary services  

## Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) – Port scanning
